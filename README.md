# The YK Pao School Songjiang Campus Daily Bulletin

Daily Bulletins are bulletin boards for students and staff at the
Songjiang campus of [YK Pao School](https://ykpaoschool.cn), which are
delivered by email every school day. They contain information such as
itineraries notices, Daily Inspirations, exam schedules (if there are
exam sessions ongoing), the daily menu, etc.

This repository contains the source code of the modern Daily Bulletin's
build system.

## GitHub Mirror

Because many contributors use GitHub, there is a
[GitHub mirror](https://github.com/runxiyu/sjdb-src)
**which may lag behind the other repositories a little**.
You are advised to send patches to the
[public mailing list](https://lists.sr.ht/~runxiyu/sjdb)
whenever possible, but if you must use GitHub, you could submit a pull
request, and it will be reviewed (although it would be faster if you
just email the patch properly). Another GitHub-based workflow would
be to use git-request-pull to send me a pull request via email.
